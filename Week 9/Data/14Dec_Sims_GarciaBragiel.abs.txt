The purpose of this project is to conduct a cost estimate for an Arctic-capable surface combatant that will support future United States operations in the Arctic to meet national security objectives. The United States is at a pivotal point with respect to its role in securing its interests in the Arctic. The Arctic is rapidly transforming from a relatively isolated region to one of increased human access due to receding ice. The changes that will take place in the Arctic region, and the challenges and opportunities these changes will bring, demand greater attention from the United States and its partners around the world. After conducting a hybrid cost estimate, combining a parametric analysis of foreign Arctic surface vessels with an analogy approach based on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the United States Navy could acquire an Arctic surface vessel costing approximately $1.5 billion, roughly $300 million less than the current Arleigh Burke design. We recommend that the United States start building Arctic-capable surface vessels as soon as fiscally possible. Realistically, the United States should pair Arctic surface vessels with a more robust air, sub-surface, and unconventional warfare capability in the future to make the U.S. a more prepared Arctic nation.
