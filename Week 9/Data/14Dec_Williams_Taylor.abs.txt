Effectively allocating Navy recruiting resources to recruiting stations requires an understanding of the market factors that influence a station’s expected production. Currently, Navy Recruiting Command (NRC), N5 (Research) uses an index constructed from 18 factors describing the stations operating environment to identify a stations recruiting potential. This research develops alternative models to identify a station’s potential, both over a threeyear and monthly period and compares this to models using only the index value. Regression techniques provide models with more explanatory power than models using only the constructed index, while using only a subset of the 18 factors for the current index. These models will be used by NRC N5 to inform market analysis and by NRC N7 (Training) within their training game for Navy Recruit District (NRD) leaders.
