The Joint Platform Allocation Tool (JPAT) is a tool currently used to inform Army decision makers on resource management, procurement, and operational employment of Army aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets. The tool is modeled and implemented using point estimates for input data on future resource, equipment capability, and employment demand. This research expands the capability of the JPAT to account for uncertainty and changes in those parameters that bear on the overall operational risk of the Armyâ€™s ISR mission: uncertain and changing future budgets, and uncertainty and unpredictability of future operational demands for ISR assets. Techniques of robust optimization are explored and applied to JPAT, and results and methodology are shown to be applicable to other operational areas.
