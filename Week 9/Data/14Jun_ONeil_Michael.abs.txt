Human systems integration (HSI) applies knowledge of human capabilities and limitations to design more efficient, effective and safe military systems. HSI can enable impressive lifecycle cost savings and performance gains when implemented. In practice, HSI activities are hampered by the complexity of human-technology integration issues. This thesis develops a simplified framework for understanding and assessing HSI throughout the acquisition process. An HSI Activity Model is presented to conceptualize HSI activity in military acquisition. Established human factors and human computer interaction theories are applied to develop a concise view of HSI in action. The core activity of HSI is summarized as the balancing of human capabilities and limitations with the affordances and constraints presented by system technology, to accomplish system objectives. A Comprehensive Human Integration Evaluation Framework (CHIEF) is then developed to provide the acquisition community with a viable tool for assessing HSI during acquisition. A measurement approach, rating scales and criteria, and a consolidated scoring matrix are developed based on lessons gathered from current system assessment measures, and refinement with HSI practitioners. If implemented, the HSI Activity Model and CHIEF offer the potential to increase HSI understanding and awareness, leading to improved system outcomes across the DHS acquisition enterprise.
