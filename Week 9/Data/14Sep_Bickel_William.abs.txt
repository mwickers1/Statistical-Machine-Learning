The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Capability Analysis and Assessment Division (OPNAV N81), along with other DOD organizations, utilizes the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) as its primary campaign analysis tool. STORM aids senior-level policymakers in evaluating military strategy and capabilities, force structure, and operational effectiveness. This is a proof-of-concept thesis that determines the feasibility of implementing a simple design of experiments within the complicated framework of STORM. Such a capability will enable quicker and more robust estimates of proposed force structure trade-offs. After utilizing various methods and statistical techniques, this thesis concludes that it is possible to implement small designs within STORM that could offer useful insights to OPNAV N81 analysts. However, the steps needed to successfully complete a design are far from automated and fairly complex. Currently, they require a great deal of time to manually apply. As a pilot study, these results pave the way for future researchers to apply our results to a realworld, classified scenario.
