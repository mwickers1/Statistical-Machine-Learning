This thesis provides data analysis on the selection process of the FY 2009–2011 Army Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) colonel selection boards. In this analytic study, logistic regression is used to study what variables influence colonel selection. The focus of this study is to aid Army senior leaders in the mentoring and development of future senior leaders by identifying criteria key to the selection of Army AGR colonels. A data set is compiled from 1144 individual promotion packets submitted across three selection boards. The 1144 packets correspond to 684 individuals. The findings suggest one’s zone of consideration, age, longest deployment, senior service college completion, possession of a master’s degree, battalion command, number of ratings as a lieutenant colonel, and the total percentage above center of mass ratings have a significant influence on selection.
