This thesis presents Navy Operational Planner (NOP), a decision support aid for missionbased maritime operational planning. Operational plans consist of individual missions grouped into phasesâ€”we must accomplish a given fraction of each mission in a phase to declare completion and move to the next phase. Rather than trying to achieve as many missions as possible in a fixed time horizon, NOP advises how to allocate multiple ships to multiple missions in order to accomplish those missions to a prescribed level of completion as quickly as possible; this allows a transition to the next phase of a larger mission, such as a war, or a large-scale humanitarian aid and disaster relief operation. Knowing how long it could take to complete a mission phase is more useful in determining feasibility in the planning process and can help in assessing risks associated with employing a limited number of ships. Criteria for mission phase transitions are derived from assumptions surrounding mission-based accomplishment thresholds. The carrying out of a mission or level of effort applied contributes toward cumulative accomplishment. In addition, when mission efforts are interrupted for some period of time, the mission may require additional later effort to resume and complete.
