This research creates the Marine Corps Equipment Redistribution Model (MCERM). MCERM is a mathematical optimization model that can be used as a decision-support prototype to guide Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) in planning asset redistribution to satisfy subordinate units’ training and equipping requirements. MCERM implements a mixed-integer, linear program that selects sets of equipment transfers between units in order to raise overall readiness for priority units. MCERM optimally minimizes both (a) a function of transit distance and equipment size to transfer equipment to a unit (used as a surrogate for actual transfer cost), and (b) inventory shortages. MCERM allows planners to influence recommended transfers by (a) placing a weighted penalty on transfers that cross between commands, and (b) increasing the shortage penalty over the transfer penalty. It also enables the use of substitute equipment at an additional penalty. A realistic test case analyzes all equipment to unit ownerships reported by MARFORRES on April 22, 2016. From the results, MCERM’s recommended transfers decreased the overall shortage penalty by a large margin while incurring a relatively low transfer penalty. This prototype enables planners to review the entire MARFORRES equipment redistribution problem, select optimized solutions, and perform fast sensitivity analysis on the competing objectives.
