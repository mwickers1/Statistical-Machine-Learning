The defense of a naval ship berthed in a harbor is a complex task affected by many factors. These include the fishing vessel density close to the ship and the challenge of discriminating neutral vessels from threats. A naval vessel berthed at harbor is more susceptible to attack than a vessel in open seas. The chances of detecting and countering a terrorist boat vary widely depending on several factors, including early identification of the attack and weapons available. This research uses modeling in Map Aware Non-uniform Automata (MANA) to analyze the protection measures adopted by naval vessels against terrorist boats. Design of experiments is used to efficiently generate data, which is then replicated using highperformance computing, to address a wide range of possibilities and outcomes. The data generated is analyzed using a variety of techniques. The study concludes that lethality of Blue weapons is the most important factor in determining Blue’s ability to counter a Red suicide boat attack. Additionally, the tactic of firing a warning shot followed by disabling shots within the exclusion zone decreases Blue’s success probability. Finally, an exclusion zone of at least 60 meters that is enforced with a patrol boat is recommended.
