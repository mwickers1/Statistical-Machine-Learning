The 2016 United States Marine Corps (USMC) Aviation Plan establishes the timeline to transition all F/A-18 Hornet squadrons to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Ensuring Hornets can continue to support operational requirements during this transition is a challenge. In this thesis we address the management of the USMC Hornet inventory by developing, implementing, and testing an integer linear program called Hornet Assignment Sundown Model (HASM). HASM prescribes each individual Hornet’s monthly squadron assignment, utilization, maintenance, storage, and retirement over its remaining service life while ensuring each squadron satisfies (to the extent possible) monthly flight hour requirements. To test HASM, this thesis develops forecasts of monthly squadron flight hour requirements and readiness rates from randomly and uniformly generated values using median performance with noise as inputs. Computational analysis using unclassified information on the USMC Hornet inventory demonstrate HASM’s ability to illustrate the impact of management strategies on meeting future requirements. This thesis identifies future shortfalls and assesses requirement reductions to mitigate them so that resources can be applied to efficiently and effectively preserve the combat capability of the Marine Corps Air Ground Task Force.
