Joint maritime operational planning is the difficult task of assigning various platforms to accomplish a multitude of missions in several areas of operations. The task becomes more difficult as resources are limited, mission requirements evolve, and platform capabilities vary. Emerging threats and technology in the undersea domain have created renewed interest and increased the priority of undersea warfare (USW) planning. This thesis develops and provides a proof-of-concept for a decisionsupport tool to aid operational planning in a USW environment. Specifically, it provides an optimization model with an optimal solution that maximizes multimission achievement in a theater USW environment through the scheduling of surface, sub-surface, and air assets over a non-fixed time horizon. Tactics and their mathematical representation are an input to our model. This makes the model easily adapted to any USW scenario and other warfare areas where mission achievement can be measured quantitatively.
