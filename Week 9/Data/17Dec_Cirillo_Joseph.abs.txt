Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a well-studied disease that remains prevalent in the United States. While the risk of death from HIV has decreased, the disease still claims lives each year. Beyond mortality rates, there is great interest in understanding and improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in infected persons. HRQOL is driven by an individualâ€™s health perceptions, physical functionality, and psychological well-being, and is influenced by community and environmental indicators. Studies of HRQOL are generally associated with healthcare use, disability diagnoses, assessment of behavioral risk, and common health outcomes: mortality and morbidity. The HRQOL of U.S. military members infected with HIV is a prevalent area of research. Increased understanding of service members infected with HIV, and subsequently how their quality of life persists with the disease, is critical for maintaining and improving military readiness and capabilities. The purpose of this study is to further analyze the association between age-related comorbidities and quality-of-life measures specifically among HIV-positive active duty service members.
