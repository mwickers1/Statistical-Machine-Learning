Planning airborne operations for a flight of aircraft to drop heavy equipment and paratroopers on a target dropzone is complicated. This thesis presents the Tactical Crossload Planner (TCP), an optimization-based decision support tool that rapidly devises a tactical crossload (a combination of paratroopers and equipment) to be loaded on multiple, heterogeneous aircraft for delivery in one or two low passes over a target dropzone. The optimization model captures an airborne commanderâ€™s intent and best reflects priorities for the operation while meeting detailed operational requirements set out in the Airborne Standard Operating Procedure (ASOP).
