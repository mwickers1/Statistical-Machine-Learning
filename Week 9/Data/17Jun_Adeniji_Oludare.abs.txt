The Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the U.S. Marine Corpsâ€™ premiere forward-deployed force that possesses the capability to provide self-sustainment for a minimum of 15 days. This thesis takes a close look at how the U.S. Marine Corps supports expeditionary deployments. Expeditionary logistics has long been a challenge within the Department of Defense. This study focuses on improving the level of organic support available to deployed units. More importantly, it examines the methodology used to build the class IX block embarked on ship prior to deployment. The class IX block is defined as a repository of maintenance items available on-ship throughout the deployment without external support. The sample data used in this research is an accurate representation of an Equipment Density Listing (EDL) used in support of a deploying MEU. The goal of this thesis is to provide results that can be compared to historical data to evaluate model and simulation outputs. This thesis provides recommendations on improving the methodology implemented in building class IX blocks for future expeditionary deployments, including the need to gather and retain more data to better understand uncertainties in parts usage. Lastly, recommendations are given for future studies in support of MEU equipment sustainment.
