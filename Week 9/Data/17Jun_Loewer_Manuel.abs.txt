There are several problems that limit the availability of modern-type helicopters that the German Army has been acquiring during the last ten years, including inspection policies, reliability, spare parts availability, and the number of personnel devoted to aircraft maintenance. The goal of this thesis is to identify factors that could lead to measurable improvement in operational availability and flight-hour supply of the German Army helicopter fleet. This research uses statistical analysis of failure-time data and a simulation model that emulates the usage and maintenance policies adopted by the fleet. The simulation model reflects normal daily operating and maintenance activities and manages individual aircraft with respect to flying operations
