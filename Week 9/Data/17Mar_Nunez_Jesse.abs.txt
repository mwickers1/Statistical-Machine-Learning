Due to uncertainty in target locations, stochastic models are implemented to provide a representation of location distribution. The reliability of these models has a profound effect on the ability to successfully interdict these targets. A key factor in the reliability of a model is the incorporation of information updates. A common method for incorporating information updates is Kalman filtering. However, given the probable nonlinear and nonGaussian nature of target movement models, the fidelity of solutions provided by Kalman filtering could be significantly degraded. A more robust methodology needs to be employed. This thesis uses an updating algorithm known as particle filtering to incorporate information updates concerning the targetâ€™s position. Particle filtering is a nonparametric filtering technique that is adaptable and flexible. The particle filter is incorporated into a model that uses a stochastic process known as a Brownian bridge to model target movement. A Brownian bridge models target movement with minimal information and allows for uncertainty during periods when target location is unknown. As new intelligence arrives, the particle filter is used to update a probabilistic heat map of target position. The main goal of this thesis is to design a stochastic model integrating both the Brownian bridge model and particle filtering.
