Firing multiple rounds of artillery from the same location has several benefits: a high rate of fire at the enemy and potentially improved accuracy as the shooter’s aim adjusts to previous rounds. Firing many rounds from the same location, however, carries significant risk that the enemy will detect the location of the artillery. Therefore, the shooter may want to periodically change location to avoid counter-battery fire. This maneuver is known as the shoot-and-scoot tactic. The importance of the shoot-and-scoot tactic has increased in recent years with the prevalence of self-propelled artillery and significant improvements in counter-detection technology such as radar. This thesis analyzes the shoot-and-scoot tactic using stochastic models, such as continuous-time Markov chains. We explore various examples and conclude that spending a reasonable amount of time firing multiple shots in the same location is preferable to moving immediately after firing one shot. Moving frequently reduces risk to artillery, but limits the artillery’s ability to inflict damage on the enemy. These results should provide commanders with insight about how frequently they should change positions based on the risk level and their capabilities.
