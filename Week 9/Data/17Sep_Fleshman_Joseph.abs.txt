Navy sailors administratively begin and end their careers through the Pay and Personnel Management Department (PERS-2). The current pay and personnel service delivery model is manpower heavy and relies on legacy systems. High costs and rigid, face-to-face antiquated systems fail to provide flexible consistent Human Resources (HR) support to a technology-competent generation. Our efforts are focused on providing a quantitative effort to understanding past trends in Personnel Support Detachment (PSD) and Customer Service Desk (CSD) transactions that may aid manpower policies in the future composition of the pay and personnel services delivery model. Methods include data visualization techniques and multiple linear regression modeling. Our analysis supports a consolidation effort where size of PSD or CSD does not affect performance but transaction volume does. The workforce mix of the unit also affects performance. PSDs and CSDs with higher percentages of military and civilian contractor personnel have higher rates of timeliness and acceptance. The future pay and personnel service delivery model will benefit from streamlined processes and concentrated efforts.
