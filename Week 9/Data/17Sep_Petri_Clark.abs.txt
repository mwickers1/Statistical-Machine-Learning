Electrical distribution systems are the last stage of electricity delivery, bridging the gap between transmission networks and the customer. Compared to transmission systems, there has been comparatively little analysis performed on distribution infrastructure. We first establish a minimum load shed optimal switching model. The model seeks to ensure all electricity demand is met for a given distribution system by minimizing the amount of load not met. This is accomplished by closing and opening switches within the network, subject to various electrical physics constraints. We initially test our model against a simple toy network to verify proper operation before expanding to increasingly complex networks. We culminate with testing against a standardized test circuit. The model runs in an open-source programming language on a consumer-grade lap-top, reading in data from common formats with solvers readily familiar to the optimization community.
