The results from a four-year longitudinal study executed from 2003â€“2007 at the United States Military Academy (USMA) indicated that Cadets sleep significantly less than the amount recommended for their age group. The current report presents the initial findings from a two-part study undertaken in the fall of 2017 to determine whether the sleep and nap duration of Cadets attending USMA has changed in the intervening years. Actigraphy data from 269 Cadets from all four year groups was collected for analysis. The results indicate that current Cadets sleep more at nighttime than their predecessors both on school nights (current average = 5.24 hours), with current Cadets obtaining 0.19 hours (11 minutes) more than their predecessors (p < 0.001), and on weekend nights (current average = 6.95 hours), with current Cadets obtaining 0.47 hours (28 minutes) more than their predecessors (p < 0.001). Sleep duration was significantly influenced by day type (school day or weekend), gender, and year group, corroborating the findings of the previous study. Cadets nap longer on weekends and most frequently on Thursdays. The results of this analysis extend the body of knowledge about sleep in the late-adolescent military population and provide insight into the sleep patterns and behaviors of USMA Cadets. Suggestions for additional research are also proposed.
