Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major health threat for the United States and the world, and HIV has affected the lives of millions of people including members in the U.S. military. The objective of this thesis is to analyze how HIV-positive active duty members use military healthcare. Using the dataset of active duty members who are currently engaging in the U.S. military HIV Natural History Study (NHS) cohort, the analysis examines the relationship among the annual number of appointments, the top three medical reasons for the appointments, the clinical laboratory data, and the patientâ€™s healthcare utilization during a period of five years after seroconversion. The four final models incorporated multiple linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, and cross-validation. These models can provide useful insights and predictions on healthcare utilization so that DoD medical planners can forecast and manage an appropriate amount of HIV care resources in the future.
