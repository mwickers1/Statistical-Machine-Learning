The Marine Corps manages a centralized secondary reparable inventory of over 1,000 different items with an enterprise-wide retail value of more than $600 million. These secondary reparable items are those components and subcomponents deemed economical to repair based on their expected costs and life cycles. The current ad hoc procedure to determine how to replenish each damaged secondary reparable relies on coordination between multiple organizations using information from various sources and varies from location to location. Ongoing Marine Corps efforts aim to determine the effectiveness of the Centralized Secondary Reparable Management Program by analyzing the cost and quality of these repairs and assessing the current manning of Marine maintenance activities. This thesis develops optimization models to assist in the determination of how to conduct these component repairs in the timeliest and least costly manner. Results from the model demonstrate the value of the organizations currently integrated into the secondary repairable maintenance cycle. Additionally, the solution provides strong evidence to support repair policies based on national stock numbers and location, drastically reducing the complexity of the current ad hoc procedures.
