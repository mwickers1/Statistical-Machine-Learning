The concept of Distributed Maritime Operations intends to enable a force that is capable of winning a fleet-on-fleet engagement through the integration of manned and unmanned systems, execution of deceptive tactics, and emboldening of units to conduct offensive strikes. This report contributes to the concept of DMO in the 2030–2035 timeframe through the development of an operational simulation that examines the ability for various compositions of multi-domain fleet assets to perform tactical operations in a naval combat environment. This project studies the impact of the friendly force employment of deception and tactics against an enemy force, and the resulting impact on the adversary’s ability to progress through the various stages of a kill chain. Through the development and analysis of a discrete event simulation, this research investigates the ability for naval forces in the air, surface, and electromagnetic warfare domains to contribute to DMO through the performance of tactical offensive operations and employment of deceptive tactics. The analysis resulted in two major findings. In terms of force composition, an increased number of missile carrying assets had the largest impact on operational effectiveness and survivability. Tactically, the utilization of electronic jamming, coupled with the utilization of unmanned deceptive swarms, provided a significant improvement in the survivability of friendly force assets as well as the attrition of enemy forces.
