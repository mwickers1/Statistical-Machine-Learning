There is growing evidence that organizational architectures of military Command and Control (C2) systems are evolving from multiple layered, hierarchical (top-down) commands to more adaptable commands of networked teams. This research presents a “first principles” approach to developing a computational framework to measure and compare the organizational architecture of any military unit or commercial business. The developed construct takes the form of a game that imitates processes an organization must accomplish to reach an objective. Supported by mathematical analysis, we implement the framework as a simulation to measure the effectiveness of various organizational architectures. We explore performance advantages of different architectures when an organization’s objective and/or operating environment change.
