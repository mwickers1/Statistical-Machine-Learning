The U.S. Navy is concerned with the psychological resilience of its sailors. The Navy has developed multiple programs as part of the 21st Century Sailor and Marine initiative to promote resilient behaviors. In order to determine the effectiveness of these programs, the Navy must have a valid tool to assess psychological resilience. The Naval Center for Combat and Operational Stress Control developed the Servicemember Evaluation Tool (SET) to assess its internal resilience-training program. This thesis examines the use of the SET in an operational setting by collecting data from five naval vessels on deployment. The goals of this thesis are to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SET on this sample population. Furthermore, this thesis identifies potential improvements to the SET to make it more efficient for operational use.
