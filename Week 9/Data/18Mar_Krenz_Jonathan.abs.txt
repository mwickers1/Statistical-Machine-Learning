As countries around the world develop long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), the current method of replenishing warships at sea may no longer be viable. These long-range ASBMs can be used to target combat logistic force (CLF) ships, resulting in the degradation of the warships’ mission without targeting of the warships. Currently, the U.S. Navy has approximatively 30 ships in its CLF fleet. The destruction or damage to a few of these ships would have a devastating impact on Navy surface operations. B. D. Colburn’s 2015 thesis, Preserving Logistical Support for Deployed Battle Groups in an Anti-access, Area Denial (A2AD) Environment, developed an optimization model to consider the use of “mini-CLF” ships to shuttle fuel to deployed Carrier Task Force (CTF)/Cruiser/Destroyer (CRUDES) surface action groups (SAGs) and forwarddeployed units while at sea. In practice, however, multiple commodities such as fuel, stores, and ammunition are required to keep ships operating during peacetime and wartime situations. This thesis extends Colburn’s model to include all of these commodities and exercises the model on four case studies.
