Evolving anti-ship ballistic missiles are enhancing the effectiveness of anti-access (A2) strategies, which seek to keep opposing forces out of an operating area. This may reduce the effectiveness of legacy U.S. Navy operational principles, which rely on large, multi-ship carrier strike groups. In response, the Navy created an offensive principle known as distributed lethality (DL) that would allow warships to project power within an A2 environment. DL calls for smaller, agile, and lethal combinations of ships, called adaptive force packages (AFPs), which operate in a distributed manner over a large area. This concept brings about the logistical challenge of satisfying distributed demand across many locations. Moreover, the A2 environment poses a threat to the Navy’s standard resupply source, the Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship. CLF ships can no longer afford to travel close to forward deployed units. These developments require modifications in the Navy’s combat logistics chain. This thesis modifies the Navy combat logistics chain to support small- and medium-size warships operating as AFPs within a DL and A2 environment and analyzes requirements for the development of mini-CLF ships as the main AFP resupply source.
