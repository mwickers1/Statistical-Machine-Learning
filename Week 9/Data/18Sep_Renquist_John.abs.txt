The Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) is a stochastic campaign-level simulation model used by the Department of Defense to provide insight into military strategy, capabilities, and campaign analysis. Recent enhancements to STORM incorporate several energy-related features and logistical considerations. The primary focus of this research was to assess and explore the energy-related enhancements to STORM (known as STORM-E) using data farming. That is, embedding STORM-E in an environment using sophisticated designs of experiments and a computing cluster allows researchers to get faster and more comprehensive results. This research assists in model verification and validation efforts by examining the impact of a large number of STORM-E energy-related inputs on multiple model responses. A total of 1,700 campaigns were simulated using an efficient design of experiments. By using an efficient design and a computing cluster, the time to complete the simulations was reduced from an estimated 12,000 years to 121 hours. The new energy features have been shown to impact both logistic and mission-oriented measures in intuitive ways, thus enhancing our confidence in STORM-Eâ€™s new energy features.
